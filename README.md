# TikTok ERV Calculator

This Python application calculates a TikTok profile's Engagement Rate by Views (ERV). It uses the Playwright library to scrape TikTok data instead of integrating with TikTok API because it's unavailable for everyone. It scrapes post views, likes, comments, and shares, and then computes the ERV based on the formula:

ERV = (Total Engagements / Total Views) * 100

(Total Engagements = Likes + Comments + Shares)

The application uses a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter using AI, allowing users to input a TikTok username and view the results in real-time. It also includes a logging window to display the scraping process and any errors encountered.

## üöÄ Features
##### ‚Ä¢ Scrapes TikTok Data: Extracts post views, likes, comments, and shares from the last 10 non-pinned posts.

##### ‚Ä¢ Converts Abbreviated Numbers: Handles values like 2.7M (2.7 million) or 1.5K (1.5 thousand) and converts them into integers.

##### ‚Ä¢ Threaded Execution: Runs the scraping process in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.

##### ‚Ä¢ Error Handling: Provides clear error messages if the profile is private, the page structure changes, or the username is invalid.

##### ‚Ä¢ Logging: Displays detailed logs of the scraping process in the GUI.
